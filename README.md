## üìÑ Abstract
<p align="justify">Medical imaging and their reports are essential in healthcare, providing crucial insights into internal structures and abnormalities for diagnosis and treatment. However, medical radiology report generation is time-consuming and further complicated by the shortage of expert radiologists. This paper presents a deep learning-based prior knowledge-aware transformer network designed to address the challenges of aligning and fusing medical images with textual data. Our method integrates medical signals of contextual biomedical entities and auxiliary medical knowledge embeddings extracted from reports with the visual features of radiology images to enhance alignment. Further, to tackle the fusion issue, we introduce Prior-KnowledgeAware-Report-Generator, a novel module with pre-normalization layers designed to improve training stability and efficiency, a prior knowledge-aware cross-attention mechanism to focus on multi-modal unified fused prior knowledge representation of radiology images and medical signals, and a feedforward layer utilizing the SwiGLU gated activation function, enhancing receptive field coverage. This ensures the model effectively incorporates and exploits prior medical knowledge to generate high-quality reports. We evaluate our method using standard natural language generation metrics on three widely used publicly available datasets - IUXRAY, COVCTR, and PGROSS. Our approach achieves average Bleu scores of 0.383, 0.647, and 0.191 for the respective datasets, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods further evidenced by rigorous ablation and qualitative analysis conducted that taps into the contributions of various components of our model granting relevant clinical insights. The results demonstrate that the fusion of medical signals with radiology images significantly improves report accuracy and alignment with clinical findings, providing valuable assistance to radiologists.</p>
